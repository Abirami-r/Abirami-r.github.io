PyCon India is the largest gathering of Python enthusiasts in India. It is a community-run conference celebrating the use of Python Software across a wide variety of industries. The conference was (virtually) attended by more than 600 participants including working professionals, students, and hobbyists. My talk about Self Driving cars was selected from over 200 proposals. My talk explored the use of OpenCV in tackling a variety of challenges related to Self Driving cars. This included topics like obstacle avoidance, lane detection, traffic light, and sign detection, pedestrian detection in detail, and how I implemented it. The talk was well received and it was a great experience for me overall. I got to meet other people who are working on similar projects, hear their ideas, and explore future collaboration.

Cryptography is used to solve codes. Cryptocurrency is a digital currency with encryption techniques used to regulate the generation currency and verification of transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank. A blockchain is a digital ledger in which transactions are made. A cryptocurrency and are recorded chronologically and publicly. A blockchain is also a secure way to store data as every message is converted to a hash and is then stored. To date, itâ€™s been impossible to hack into a blockchain. StudentChain is a blockchain model with distributed ledgers with peer-to-peer verification of student IDs to prevent the misuse of student discounts. SHA-256 is the algorithm using python language used in StudentChain.","tags":[],"title":"Cryptography and its applications in Blockchain (StudentChain)","type":"publication"}]
